                    <h1 class="heading py-2 font-bold" align="center">WHAT IS THIS SITE?</h1>
                    <p align="justify"> this site displays the lunch and dinner menu for arrillaga family dining commons, but generally that's representative of all stanford dining halls' menus. unfortunately, i can't predict specials, so you won't find those here. </p>

                    <h1 class="heading py-2 font-bold" align="center">WHY?</h1>
                    <p align="justify"> i built this site to learn web development. it's not too seriousâ€”think <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/"><u>programming as home-cooking</u></a>. i realized it would be cool if someone made a prettier version of the stanford dining hall menu, one that was easier to navigate. i have that kind of idea a lot, but  this time it aligned with something I've wanted to learn for awhile. so I built it! (kind of, see "TECH STUFF" for a better description of everything i screwed up.)</p>

                    <p align="justify"> i was not authorized by, nor am i affiliated with, rd&e or any other stanford dining organization. i'm simply displaying the content they already publish freely. they own the displayed content, i guess. </p>

                        <p> before i built this, i'd never written to a real database or read from one, either. that means this site is pretty janky. you'll notice the load time is a bit slow. that's really frustrating to me because i built this to make viewing the menu more pleasant. to be clear, that's totally my fault: the code that reads the database when you go to <a href="index.html"><u>entree.today</u></a> runs in the browser. i now know it should run on a server. i just don't know enough to actually make that happen. so anyway, longer, weirder loading times are here to stay for now. </p>
